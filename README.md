Current goal is to implement most parts of the System and Systems API as well as 
some of the Commander and Logs API. Everything else is _not planned_ at the 
moment.

Throw money at me and I’ll do what you want :)

Whatever is currently implemented is likely to change on a whim until there’s 
a first release. You have been warned.

## Things You Probably Want to Use ##

This paragraph will eventually explain how to use this contraption effectively.  
Until then, have fun :)

## Things You Probably Don’t Want to Use ##

Once I’ve actually written it, you’ll find the documentation for the actual API 
wrappers that return raw JSON linked here, including example outputs.

If you run into any problems, please look at the 
[develop](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/pyEDSM/tree/develop) branch and see 
if it’s fixed there already.

If you have no idea what I was saying in that last paragraph and / or the things 
mentioned there don’t fix your problem, please [file an 
issue](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/pyEDSM/issues). Thanks! :)

You can also [say “Hi” on Discord](https://discord.gg/Y8qM7N) if that is your 
thing.
